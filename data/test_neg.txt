test_neg0 it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
test_neg1 [garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
test_neg2 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
test_neg3 not so much farcical as sour . 
test_neg4 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
test_neg5 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
test_neg6 interesting , but not compelling . 
test_neg7 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
test_neg8 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
test_neg9 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
test_neg10 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
test_neg11 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
test_neg12 our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
test_neg13 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
test_neg14 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
test_neg15 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
test_neg16 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
test_neg17 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
test_neg18 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
test_neg19 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
test_neg20 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
test_neg21 when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
test_neg22 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
test_neg23 pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
test_neg24 an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
test_neg25 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
test_neg26 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
test_neg27 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
test_neg28  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
test_neg29 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
test_neg30 the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
test_neg31 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
test_neg32 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
test_neg33  . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
test_neg34 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
test_neg35 if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
test_neg36 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
test_neg37 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
test_neg38 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
test_neg39 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
test_neg40 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
test_neg41 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
test_neg42 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
test_neg43 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
test_neg44 the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
test_neg45 completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
test_neg46 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
test_neg47 adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
test_neg48 it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
test_neg49 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
test_neg50 terminally brain dead production . 
test_neg51 some episodes work , some don't . 
test_neg52 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
test_neg53 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
test_neg54 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
test_neg55 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
test_neg56 will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
test_neg57 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
test_neg58 a processed comedy chop suey . 
test_neg59 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
test_neg60 full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
test_neg61 the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
test_neg62 it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
test_neg63 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
test_neg64 so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
test_neg65 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
test_neg66 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
test_neg67 as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
test_neg68 solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
test_neg69 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
test_neg70 [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
test_neg71 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
test_neg72 by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
test_neg73 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
test_neg74 exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
test_neg75 calculated swill . 
test_neg76 this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
test_neg77 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
test_neg78 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
test_neg79 i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
test_neg80 fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
test_neg81 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
test_neg82 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
test_neg83 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
test_neg84 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
test_neg85 rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
test_neg86 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
test_neg87 the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
test_neg88 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
test_neg89 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
test_neg90 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
test_neg91 it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
test_neg92 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
test_neg93 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
test_neg94 with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
test_neg95 the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
test_neg96 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . 
test_neg97 this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
test_neg98 [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
test_neg99 puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
test_neg100 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
test_neg101 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
test_neg102 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
test_neg103 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
test_neg104 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
test_neg105 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
test_neg106 bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
test_neg107 the worst film of the year . 
test_neg108 if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
test_neg109 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
test_neg110 the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
test_neg111 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
test_neg112 the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
test_neg113 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
test_neg114 unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
test_neg115 it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
test_neg116 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
test_neg117 all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
test_neg118 a big fat pain . 
test_neg119 a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
test_neg120 aan opportunity wasted . 
test_neg121 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
test_neg122 though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
test_neg123 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
test_neg124 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
test_neg125 diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
test_neg126 silly , loud and goofy . 
test_neg127 why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
test_neg128 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
test_neg129 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
test_neg130 it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
test_neg131 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
test_neg132 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
test_neg133 bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
test_neg134 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
test_neg135 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
test_neg136  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
test_neg137 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
test_neg138 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
test_neg139 this is amusing for about three minutes . 
test_neg140 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
test_neg141 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
test_neg142 there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
test_neg143 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
test_neg144 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
test_neg145 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
test_neg146 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
test_neg147 oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
test_neg148 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
test_neg149 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
test_neg150 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
test_neg151 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
test_neg152 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
test_neg153 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
test_neg154 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
test_neg155 it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
test_neg156 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
test_neg157 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
test_neg158 as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
test_neg159 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
test_neg160 this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
test_neg161 less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
test_neg162 that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
test_neg163 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
test_neg164 i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
test_neg165 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
test_neg166 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
test_neg167 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
test_neg168 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
test_neg169 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
test_neg170 wait for it to hit cable . 
test_neg171 the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
test_neg172 [at least] moore is a real charmer . 
test_neg173 john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
test_neg174 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
test_neg175 unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
test_neg176 a film that loses sight of its own story . 
test_neg177 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
test_neg178 gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
test_neg179 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
test_neg180 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
test_neg181  . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
test_neg182 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
test_neg183 it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
test_neg184 execrable . 
test_neg185 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
test_neg186 paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
test_neg187 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
test_neg188 it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
test_neg189 despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
test_neg190 yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
test_neg191 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
test_neg192 children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
test_neg193 peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
test_neg194 a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
test_neg195 the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
test_neg196 just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
test_neg197 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
test_neg198 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
test_neg199 banal and predictable . 
test_neg200 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
test_neg201 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
test_neg202 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
test_neg203 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
test_neg204 strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
test_neg205 bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
test_neg206 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
test_neg207 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
test_neg208 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
test_neg209 responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
test_neg210 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
test_neg211 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
test_neg212 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
test_neg213 what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
test_neg214 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
test_neg215 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
test_neg216  . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
test_neg217 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
test_neg218 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
test_neg219 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
test_neg220 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
test_neg221  . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
test_neg222 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
test_neg223 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
test_neg224 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
test_neg225 what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
test_neg226 there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
test_neg227 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
test_neg228 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
test_neg229 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
test_neg230 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
test_neg231  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
test_neg232 circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
test_neg233 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
test_neg234 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
test_neg235 adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
test_neg236 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
test_neg237 typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
test_neg238 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
test_neg239  . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
test_neg240 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
test_neg241 jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
test_neg242 there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
test_neg243 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
test_neg244 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
test_neg245 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
test_neg246 you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
test_neg247 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
test_neg248 it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
test_neg249 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
test_neg250 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
test_neg251 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
test_neg252 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
test_neg253  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
test_neg254 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
test_neg255 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
test_neg256 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
test_neg257 while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
test_neg258 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
test_neg259 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
test_neg260 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
test_neg261 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
test_neg262 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
test_neg263 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
test_neg264 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
test_neg265 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
test_neg266 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
test_neg267 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
test_neg268 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
test_neg269 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
test_neg270 it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
test_neg271 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
test_neg272 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
test_neg273 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
test_neg274 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
test_neg275 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
test_neg276 despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
test_neg277 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
test_neg278 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
test_neg279 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
test_neg280 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
test_neg281 it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
test_neg282 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
test_neg283 the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
test_neg284 frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
test_neg285 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
test_neg286 no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
test_neg287 there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
test_neg288  . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
test_neg289 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
test_neg290 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
test_neg291 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
test_neg292 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
test_neg293 the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
test_neg294  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
test_neg295 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
test_neg296 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
test_neg297 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
test_neg298 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
test_neg299 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
test_neg300 in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
test_neg301 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
test_neg302 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
test_neg303 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
test_neg304 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
test_neg305 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
test_neg306 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
test_neg307 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
test_neg308 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
test_neg309 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
test_neg310 despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
test_neg311 a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
test_neg312 tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
test_neg313 too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
test_neg314 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
test_neg315 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
test_neg316 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
test_neg317 i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
test_neg318 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
test_neg319 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
test_neg320 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
test_neg321 [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
test_neg322 a bit too eager to please . 
test_neg323  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
test_neg324 so-so entertainment . 
test_neg325 one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
test_neg326 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
test_neg327 crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
test_neg328 despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
test_neg329 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
test_neg330 those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
test_neg331 from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
test_neg332 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
test_neg333 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
test_neg334 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
test_neg335 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
test_neg336 new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
test_neg337 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
test_neg338 when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
test_neg339 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
test_neg340 decent but dull . 
test_neg341 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
test_neg342 only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
test_neg343 for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
test_neg344 no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
test_neg345 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
test_neg346 thin period piece . 
test_neg347 hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
test_neg348 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
test_neg349 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
test_neg350 an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
test_neg351 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
test_neg352 the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
test_neg353 a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
test_neg354 i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
test_neg355 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
test_neg356 i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
test_neg357 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
test_neg358 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
test_neg359 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
test_neg360 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
test_neg361 trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
test_neg362 [a] stuporously solemn film . 
test_neg363 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
test_neg364  . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
test_neg365 the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
test_neg366 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
test_neg367 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
test_neg368 cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
test_neg369 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmmmight i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
test_neg370 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
test_neg371 couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
test_neg372 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
test_neg373 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
test_neg374 a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
test_neg375 this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
test_neg376 national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
test_neg377 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
test_neg378 more of a career curio than a major work . 
test_neg379 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
test_neg380 a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
test_neg381 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
test_neg382 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
test_neg383 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
test_neg384 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
test_neg385 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
test_neg386 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
test_neg387 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
test_neg388 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
test_neg389 charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
test_neg390  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
test_neg391 has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
test_neg392 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
test_neg393 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
test_neg394 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
test_neg395 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
test_neg396 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
test_neg397 it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
test_neg398 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
test_neg399 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
test_neg400 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
test_neg401 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
test_neg402 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
test_neg403 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
test_neg404 this thing is just garbage . 
test_neg405 as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
test_neg406 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
test_neg407 a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
test_neg408 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
test_neg409 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
test_neg410 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
test_neg411 a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
test_neg412 yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
test_neg413 the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
test_neg414 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
test_neg415 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
test_neg416 pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
test_neg417 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
test_neg418 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
test_neg419 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
test_neg420 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
test_neg421 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
test_neg422 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
test_neg423 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
test_neg424 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
test_neg425 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
test_neg426 constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
test_neg427 smothered by its own solemnity . 
test_neg428 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
test_neg429 there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head . 
test_neg430 if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
test_neg431 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
test_neg432 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
test_neg433 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
test_neg434 everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
test_neg435 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
test_neg436 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
test_neg437 an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
test_neg438 sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
test_neg439 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
test_neg440 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
test_neg441 rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
test_neg442 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
test_neg443 a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
test_neg444 downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
test_neg445 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
test_neg446 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
test_neg447 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
test_neg448 cinematic poo . 
test_neg449 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
test_neg450  " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
test_neg451  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
test_neg452 could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
test_neg453 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
test_neg454 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
test_neg455 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
test_neg456 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
test_neg457 the film is flat . 
test_neg458 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
test_neg459 the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
test_neg460 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
test_neg461 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
test_neg462 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
test_neg463 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
test_neg464 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
test_neg465 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
test_neg466 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
test_neg467 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
test_neg468 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
test_neg469 it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
test_neg470 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
test_neg471 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
test_neg472 shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
test_neg473 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
test_neg474 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
test_neg475 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
test_neg476 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
test_neg477 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
test_neg478 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
test_neg479 the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
test_neg480 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
test_neg481 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
test_neg482 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
test_neg483 not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
test_neg484 bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
test_neg485 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
test_neg486 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
test_neg487 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being .

test_neg489 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
test_neg490 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
test_neg491 this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
test_neg492 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
test_neg493 a moving picture that does not move . 
test_neg494 i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
test_neg495 ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
test_neg496 did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
test_neg497 it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
test_neg498 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
test_neg499 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
test_neg500 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
test_neg501 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
test_neg502 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
test_neg503 this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
test_neg504 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
test_neg505 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
test_neg506 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
test_neg507 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
test_neg508 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
test_neg509 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
test_neg510 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
test_neg511 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
test_neg512 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
test_neg513 pompous and garbled . 
test_neg514 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
test_neg515 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
test_neg516 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
test_neg517 the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
test_neg518 as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
test_neg519 bad and baffling from the get-go . 
test_neg520 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
test_neg521 at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
test_neg522 like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
test_neg523 other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
test_neg524 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
test_neg525 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
test_neg526 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
test_neg527 it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
test_neg528 skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
test_neg529 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
test_neg530 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
test_neg531 uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
test_neg532 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
test_neg533 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
test_neg534 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
test_neg535 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
test_neg536 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
test_neg537 horrible
test_neg538 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
test_neg539 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
test_neg540 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
test_neg541 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
test_neg542 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
test_neg543 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
test_neg544 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
test_neg545 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
test_neg546 doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
test_neg547 a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
test_neg548 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
test_neg549 it's splash without the jokes . 
test_neg550 shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
test_neg551 philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
test_neg552 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
test_neg553 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
test_neg554 hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
test_neg555 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
test_neg556 i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
test_neg557 two hours of junk . 
test_neg558 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
test_neg559 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
test_neg560 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
test_neg561 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
test_neg562 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
test_neg563 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
test_neg564 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
test_neg565 utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
test_neg566 like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
test_neg567 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
test_neg568 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
test_neg569 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
test_neg570 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
test_neg571 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
test_neg572 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
test_neg573 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
test_neg574 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
test_neg575 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
test_neg576 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
test_neg577 goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
test_neg578 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
test_neg579 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
test_neg580  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
test_neg581 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
test_neg582 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
test_neg583 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
test_neg584 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
test_neg585 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
test_neg586 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
test_neg587 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
test_neg588 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
test_neg589 this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
test_neg590 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
test_neg591 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
test_neg592 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
test_neg593 although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
test_neg594 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
test_neg595 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
test_neg596 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
test_neg597 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
test_neg598 this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
test_neg599 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
test_neg600 the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
test_neg601 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
test_neg602  . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
test_neg603 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
test_neg604 well-meaning but inert . 
test_neg605 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
test_neg606 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
test_neg607  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
test_neg608 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
test_neg609 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
test_neg610 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
test_neg611 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
test_neg612 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
test_neg613 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
test_neg614  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
test_neg615 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
test_neg616 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
test_neg617 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
test_neg618 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
test_neg619 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
test_neg620 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
test_neg621 there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
test_neg622 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
test_neg623 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
test_neg624 shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
test_neg625 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
test_neg626  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
test_neg627 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
test_neg628 while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
test_neg629 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
test_neg630 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
test_neg631 comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
test_neg632 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
test_neg633 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
test_neg634 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
test_neg635 elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
test_neg636 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
test_neg637 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
test_neg638 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
test_neg639 video games are more involving than this mess . 
test_neg640 clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
test_neg641  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
test_neg642 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
test_neg643 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
test_neg644 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
test_neg645 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
test_neg646 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
test_neg647  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
test_neg648 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
test_neg649 this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
test_neg650 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
test_neg651 an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
test_neg652 more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
test_neg653 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
test_neg654 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
test_neg655 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
test_neg656 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
test_neg657 feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
test_neg658 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
test_neg659 mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
test_neg660 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
test_neg661 full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
test_neg662 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
test_neg663 if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
test_neg664 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
test_neg665 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
test_neg666 no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
test_neg667 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
test_neg668 his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
test_neg669 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
test_neg670 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
test_neg671 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
test_neg672 it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
test_neg673 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
test_neg674 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
test_neg675 taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
test_neg676 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
test_neg677 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
test_neg678 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
test_neg679 too much of the humor falls flat . 
test_neg680 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
test_neg681 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
test_neg682 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
test_neg683 no way i can believe this load of junk . 
test_neg684  " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
test_neg685 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
test_neg686 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
test_neg687  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
test_neg688 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
test_neg689 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
test_neg690  is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
test_neg691 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
test_neg692 just one bad idea after another . 
test_neg693 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
test_neg694 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
test_neg695 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
test_neg696 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
test_neg697 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
test_neg698 shrewd but pointless . 
test_neg699 an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
test_neg700 sluggish , tonally uneven . 
test_neg701 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
test_neg702 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
test_neg703 once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
test_neg704 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
test_neg705 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
test_neg706 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
test_neg707 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
test_neg708 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
test_neg709 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
test_neg710 it treats women like idiots . 
test_neg711 though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
test_neg712 almost gags on its own gore . 
test_neg713 how do you spell cliché ? 
test_neg714 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
test_neg715 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
test_neg716 you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
test_neg717 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
test_neg718 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
test_neg719 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
test_neg720 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
test_neg721 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
test_neg722 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
test_neg723 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
test_neg724 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
test_neg725 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
test_neg726 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
test_neg727 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
test_neg728 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
test_neg729 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
test_neg730 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
test_neg731 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
test_neg732 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
test_neg733 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
test_neg734 a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
test_neg735 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
test_neg736 barely gets off the ground . 
test_neg737 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
test_neg738 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
test_neg739 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
test_neg740 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
test_neg741 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
test_neg742 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
test_neg743 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
test_neg744 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
test_neg745 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
test_neg746 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
test_neg747 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
test_neg748  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
test_neg749 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
test_neg750 once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
test_neg751 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
test_neg752 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
test_neg753 there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
test_neg754 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
test_neg755 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
test_neg756 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
test_neg757 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
test_neg758 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
test_neg759  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored . 
test_neg760  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
test_neg761 i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
test_neg762 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
test_neg763 don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
test_neg764 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
test_neg765 vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
test_neg766 [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
test_neg767 generic thriller junk . teens only . 
test_neg768 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
test_neg769 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
test_neg770 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
test_neg771 there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
test_neg772 it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
test_neg773 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
test_neg774 more maudlin than sharp . 
test_neg775 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
test_neg776 it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
test_neg777 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
test_neg778 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
test_neg779 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
test_neg780  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
test_neg781 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
test_neg782 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
test_neg783 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
test_neg784 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
test_neg785 a non-mystery mystery . 
test_neg786 what an embarrassment . 
test_neg787 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
test_neg788 pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
test_neg789 [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
test_neg790 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
test_neg791 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
test_neg792 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
test_neg793 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
test_neg794 new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
test_neg795 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
test_neg796 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
test_neg797 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
test_neg798  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
test_neg799 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
test_neg800 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
test_neg801 professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
test_neg802 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
test_neg803 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
test_neg804 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
test_neg805 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
test_neg806 the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles  several of them . 
test_neg807 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
test_neg808 lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
test_neg809 exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
test_neg810 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
test_neg811  . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
test_neg812 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
test_neg813 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
test_neg814  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
test_neg815 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
test_neg816 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
test_neg817 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
test_neg818 you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
test_neg819 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
test_neg820 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
test_neg821 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
test_neg822 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
test_neg823 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
test_neg824 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
test_neg825 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
test_neg826 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
test_neg827 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
test_neg828 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
test_neg829 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
test_neg830  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
test_neg831 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
test_neg832 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
test_neg833 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
test_neg834 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
test_neg835 it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
test_neg836 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
test_neg837 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
test_neg838 if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
test_neg839 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
test_neg840 every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
test_neg841 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
test_neg842 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
test_neg843 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
test_neg844 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
test_neg845 to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
test_neg846 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
test_neg847 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
test_neg848 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
test_neg849 the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
test_neg850 one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
test_neg851 serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
test_neg852 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
test_neg853 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
test_neg854 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
test_neg855 it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
test_neg856 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
test_neg857 i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
test_neg858 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
test_neg859 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
test_neg860 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
test_neg861 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
test_neg862 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
test_neg863 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
test_neg864 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
test_neg865 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
test_neg866 a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
test_neg867 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
test_neg868 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
test_neg869 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
test_neg870 who needs love like this ? 
test_neg871 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
test_neg872 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
test_neg873 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
test_neg874 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
test_neg875 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
test_neg876 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
test_neg877 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
test_neg878 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
test_neg879 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
test_neg880 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
test_neg881 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
test_neg882 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
test_neg883 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
test_neg884 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
test_neg885 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
test_neg886 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
test_neg887 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
test_neg888 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
test_neg889 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
test_neg890 there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
test_neg891 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
test_neg892 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
test_neg893 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
test_neg894 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
test_neg895 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
test_neg896 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
test_neg897 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
test_neg898 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
test_neg899 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
test_neg900 it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
test_neg901 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
test_neg902 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
test_neg903 lacks depth . 
test_neg904 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
test_neg905 under-rehearsed and lifeless
test_neg906 you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
test_neg907 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
test_neg908 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
test_neg909 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
test_neg910 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
test_neg911 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
test_neg912 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
test_neg913 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
test_neg914 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
test_neg915 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
test_neg916 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
test_neg917  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
test_neg918 soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
test_neg919 a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
test_neg920 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
test_neg921 proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
test_neg922 topkapi this is not . 
test_neg923 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
test_neg924 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
test_neg925 i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
test_neg926 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
test_neg927 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
test_neg928 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
test_neg929 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
test_neg930 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
test_neg931  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
test_neg932 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
test_neg933 chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
test_neg934 unwieldy contraption . 
test_neg935 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
test_neg936 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
test_neg937 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
test_neg938 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
test_neg939 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
test_neg940 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
test_neg941 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
test_neg942 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
test_neg943 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
test_neg944 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
test_neg945 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
test_neg946 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
test_neg947 a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
test_neg948 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
test_neg949 it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
test_neg950 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
test_neg951 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
test_neg952 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
test_neg953 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
test_neg954 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
test_neg955 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
test_neg956 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
test_neg957 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
test_neg958 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
test_neg959 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
test_neg960 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
test_neg961 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
test_neg962 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
test_neg963 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
test_neg964 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
test_neg965 ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
test_neg966 little more than a frothy vanity project . 
test_neg967 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
test_neg968 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
test_neg969 the story really has no place to go since simone is not realshe can't provide any conflict . 
test_neg970 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
test_neg971 a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
test_neg972  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
test_neg973  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
test_neg974 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
test_neg975 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
test_neg976 there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
test_neg977 [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
test_neg978 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
test_neg979 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
test_neg980 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
test_neg981 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun  toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
test_neg982 when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
test_neg983 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
test_neg984 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
test_neg985 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
test_neg986 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
test_neg987 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
test_neg988 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
test_neg989 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
test_neg990 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
test_neg991 not even the hanson brothers can save it
test_neg992  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
test_neg993 a sour , nasty offering . 
test_neg994 feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
test_neg995 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
test_neg996 it tells more than it shows . 
test_neg997 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
test_neg998 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
test_neg999 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
test_neg1000 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
test_neg1001 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
test_neg1002  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
test_neg1003 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
test_neg1004 i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
test_neg1005 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
test_neg1006 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
test_neg1007 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
test_neg1008 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
test_neg1009 if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
test_neg1010 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
test_neg1011 an awful snooze . 
test_neg1012 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
test_neg1013 new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
test_neg1014 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
test_neg1015 the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
test_neg1016 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
test_neg1017 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
test_neg1018 godawful boring slug of a movie . 
test_neg1019 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
test_neg1020  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
test_neg1021 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
test_neg1022 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
test_neg1023 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
test_neg1024 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
test_neg1025 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
test_neg1026 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
test_neg1027 feeble comedy . 
test_neg1028 great story , bad idea for a movie . 
test_neg1029 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
test_neg1030  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
test_neg1031 a dreadful live-action movie . 
test_neg1032 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
test_neg1033 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
test_neg1034 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
test_neg1035 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
test_neg1036 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
test_neg1037 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
test_neg1038  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
test_neg1039 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
test_neg1040 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
test_neg1041 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
test_neg1042 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
test_neg1043 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
test_neg1044 all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
test_neg1045 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
test_neg1046 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
test_neg1047 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
test_neg1048 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
test_neg1049 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
test_neg1050 doesn't amount to much of anything . 
test_neg1051 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
test_neg1052 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
test_neg1053 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
test_neg1054 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
test_neg1055 what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
test_neg1056 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
test_neg1057 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
test_neg1058 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
test_neg1059 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
test_neg1060 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
test_neg1061 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
test_neg1062 the movie bounces all over the map . 
test_neg1063  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
test_neg1064 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
test_neg1065 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
test_neg1066 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
test_neg1067 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
test_neg1068 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
test_neg1069 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
test_neg1070 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
test_neg1071 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
test_neg1072 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
test_neg1073 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
test_neg1074 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
test_neg1075 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
test_neg1076 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
test_neg1077 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
test_neg1078 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
test_neg1079 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
test_neg1080 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
test_neg1081 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
test_neg1082 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
test_neg1083 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
test_neg1084 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
test_neg1085 anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
test_neg1086 this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
test_neg1087 nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
test_neg1088 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
test_neg1089 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
test_neg1090 all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
test_neg1091 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
test_neg1092 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
test_neg1093  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
test_neg1094 made by jackasses for jackasses . 
test_neg1095 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
test_neg1096 disjointed parody . 
test_neg1097 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
test_neg1098 philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
test_neg1099 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
test_neg1100 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
test_neg1101 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
test_neg1102 it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
test_neg1103 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
test_neg1104 too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
test_neg1105  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
test_neg1106 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
test_neg1107 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
test_neg1108 at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
test_neg1109 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
test_neg1110 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
test_neg1111 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
test_neg1112 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
test_neg1113  . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
test_neg1114 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
test_neg1115 it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
test_neg1116 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
test_neg1117 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
test_neg1118 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
test_neg1119 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
test_neg1120 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
test_neg1121 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
test_neg1122 when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
test_neg1123 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
test_neg1124 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
test_neg1125 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
test_neg1126 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
test_neg1127 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
test_neg1128 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
test_neg1129 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
test_neg1130 the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
test_neg1131 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
test_neg1132 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
test_neg1133 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
test_neg1134 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
test_neg1135 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
test_neg1136 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
test_neg1137 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
test_neg1138 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
test_neg1139 eh . 
test_neg1140 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
test_neg1141 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
test_neg1142 no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
test_neg1143 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
test_neg1144 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
test_neg1145 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
test_neg1146 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
test_neg1147 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
test_neg1148 denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
test_neg1149 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
test_neg1150 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
test_neg1151 there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
test_neg1152 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
test_neg1153 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
test_neg1154 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
test_neg1155 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
test_neg1156 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
test_neg1157 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
test_neg1158 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
test_neg1159 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
test_neg1160 though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
test_neg1161 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
test_neg1162 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
test_neg1163 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
test_neg1164 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
test_neg1165 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
test_neg1166 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
test_neg1167 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
test_neg1168 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
test_neg1169 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
test_neg1170 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
test_neg1171  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
test_neg1172 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
test_neg1173 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
test_neg1174 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
test_neg1175 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
test_neg1176 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
test_neg1177 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
test_neg1178 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
test_neg1179 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
test_neg1180 [nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
test_neg1181 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
test_neg1182 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
test_neg1183 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
test_neg1184 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
test_neg1185 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
test_neg1186 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
test_neg1187 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
test_neg1188 black-and-white and unrealistic . 
test_neg1189 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
test_neg1190 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
test_neg1191 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
test_neg1192 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
test_neg1193 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
test_neg1194  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
test_neg1195 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
test_neg1196 the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
test_neg1197 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
test_neg1198 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
test_neg1199 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
test_neg1200 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
test_neg1201 if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
test_neg1202 a very average science fiction film . 
test_neg1203 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
test_neg1204 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
test_neg1205 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
test_neg1206 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
test_neg1207 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
test_neg1208 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
test_neg1209 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
test_neg1210 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
test_neg1211 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
test_neg1212 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
test_neg1213 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
test_neg1214 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
test_neg1215 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
test_neg1216 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
test_neg1217  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
test_neg1218 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
test_neg1219 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
test_neg1220 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
test_neg1221 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
test_neg1222 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
test_neg1223 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
test_neg1224 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
test_neg1225 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
test_neg1226 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
test_neg1227 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
test_neg1228 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
test_neg1229 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
test_neg1230 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
test_neg1231 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
test_neg1232 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
test_neg1233 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
test_neg1234 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
test_neg1235 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
test_neg1236 it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
test_neg1237 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
test_neg1238 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
test_neg1239 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
test_neg1240 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
test_neg1241 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
test_neg1242 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
test_neg1243 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
test_neg1244 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
test_neg1245 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
test_neg1246 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
test_neg1247 national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
test_neg1248 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
test_neg1249 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
test_neg1250 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
test_neg1251 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
test_neg1252 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
test_neg1253 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
test_neg1254 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
test_neg1255 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
test_neg1256 the film's center will not hold . 
test_neg1257 as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
test_neg1258 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
test_neg1259 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
test_neg1260 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
test_neg1261 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
test_neg1262 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
test_neg1263 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
test_neg1264 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
test_neg1265 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
test_neg1266 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
test_neg1267 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
test_neg1268 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
test_neg1269 just a bloody mess . 
test_neg1270 martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
test_neg1271 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
test_neg1272 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
test_neg1273 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
test_neg1274 extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
test_neg1275 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
test_neg1276  . . . too dull to enjoy . 
test_neg1277 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
test_neg1278 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
test_neg1279 a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
test_neg1280 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
test_neg1281 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
test_neg1282 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
test_neg1283 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
test_neg1284 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
test_neg1285 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
test_neg1286 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
test_neg1287 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
test_neg1288 showtime is closer to slowtime . 
test_neg1289 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
test_neg1290 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
test_neg1291 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
test_neg1292 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
test_neg1293 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
test_neg1294 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
test_neg1295 painfully padded . 
test_neg1296 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
test_neg1297 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
test_neg1298 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
test_neg1299 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
test_neg1300 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
test_neg1301 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
test_neg1302 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
test_neg1303 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
test_neg1304  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
test_neg1305 [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
test_neg1306 don't waste your money . 
test_neg1307 there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
test_neg1308 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
test_neg1309 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
test_neg1310 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
test_neg1311 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
test_neg1312 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
test_neg1313 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
test_neg1314 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
test_neg1315 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
test_neg1316 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
test_neg1317 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
test_neg1318 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
test_neg1319 the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
test_neg1320 it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
test_neg1321 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
test_neg1322 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
test_neg1323 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
test_neg1324 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
test_neg1325 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
test_neg1326 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
test_neg1327 schindler's list it ain't . 
test_neg1328 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
test_neg1329 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks . 
test_neg1330 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
test_neg1331 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
test_neg1332 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
test_neg1333 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
test_neg1334 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
test_neg1335 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
test_neg1336 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
test_neg1337 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
test_neg1338 [newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
test_neg1339 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
test_neg1340 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
test_neg1341 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
test_neg1342 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
test_neg1343 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
test_neg1344 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
test_neg1345 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
test_neg1346 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
test_neg1347 what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
test_neg1348 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
test_neg1349 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
test_neg1350 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
test_neg1351 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
test_neg1352 fails to bring as much to the table . 
test_neg1353 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
test_neg1354 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
test_neg1355 if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
test_neg1356 i hate this movie
test_neg1357  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
test_neg1358 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
test_neg1359 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
test_neg1360 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
test_neg1361 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
test_neg1362 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
test_neg1363 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
test_neg1364 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
test_neg1365 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
test_neg1366 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
test_neg1367 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
test_neg1368 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
test_neg1369 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
test_neg1370 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
test_neg1371 the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
test_neg1372 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
test_neg1373 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
test_neg1374 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
test_neg1375 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
test_neg1376 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
test_neg1377 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
test_neg1378 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
test_neg1379 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
test_neg1380 i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
test_neg1381 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
test_neg1382 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
test_neg1383 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
test_neg1384 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
test_neg1385 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
test_neg1386 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
test_neg1387 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
test_neg1388 who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
test_neg1389 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
test_neg1390 almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
test_neg1391 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
test_neg1392 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
test_neg1393 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
test_neg1394 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
test_neg1395 the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
test_neg1396 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
test_neg1397 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
test_neg1398 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
test_neg1399 i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
test_neg1400 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
test_neg1401 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
test_neg1402 excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
test_neg1403 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
test_neg1404 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
test_neg1405 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
test_neg1406 when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
test_neg1407 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
test_neg1408 this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
test_neg1409 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
test_neg1410 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
test_neg1411 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
test_neg1412 a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
test_neg1413 there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
test_neg1414 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
test_neg1415 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
test_neg1416 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
test_neg1417 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
test_neg1418 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
test_neg1419 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
test_neg1420 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
test_neg1421 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
test_neg1422 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
test_neg1423 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
test_neg1424 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
test_neg1425 [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
test_neg1426 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
test_neg1427 a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
test_neg1428 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
test_neg1429 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
test_neg1430 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
test_neg1431 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
test_neg1432 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
test_neg1433 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
test_neg1434 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
test_neg1435 suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
test_neg1436 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
test_neg1437 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
test_neg1438 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
test_neg1439 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
test_neg1440 the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
test_neg1441 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
test_neg1442 as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
test_neg1443 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
test_neg1444 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
test_neg1445 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
test_neg1446 nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
test_neg1447 an often unfunny romp . 
test_neg1448 it bites hard . 
test_neg1449 ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
test_neg1450 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
test_neg1451 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
test_neg1452 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
test_neg1453 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
test_neg1454 make like the title and dodge this one . 
test_neg1455 this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
test_neg1456 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
test_neg1457 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
test_neg1458 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
test_neg1459 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
test_neg1460 it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
test_neg1461 would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
test_neg1462 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
test_neg1463 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
test_neg1464 halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
test_neg1465 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
test_neg1466 [a] mess . 
test_neg1467 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
test_neg1468 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
test_neg1469 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
test_neg1470 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
test_neg1471 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
test_neg1472 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
test_neg1473 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
test_neg1474 be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
test_neg1475 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
test_neg1476 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
test_neg1477  " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
test_neg1478 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
test_neg1479 entertaining enough , but nothing new
test_neg1480  . . . one resurrection too many . 
test_neg1481 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
test_neg1482 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
test_neg1483 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
test_neg1484 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
test_neg1485 observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
test_neg1486 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
test_neg1487 there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
test_neg1488 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
test_neg1489 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
test_neg1490 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
test_neg1491 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
test_neg1492 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
test_neg1493 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
test_neg1494 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
test_neg1495 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
test_neg1496 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
test_neg1497 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
test_neg1498 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
test_neg1499 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
test_neg1500 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
test_neg1501 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
test_neg1502 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
test_neg1503 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
test_neg1504 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
test_neg1505 o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
test_neg1506 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
test_neg1507 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
test_neg1508 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
test_neg1509 anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
test_neg1510 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
test_neg1511 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
test_neg1512 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
test_neg1513 a pretentious mess . 
test_neg1514 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
test_neg1515 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
test_neg1516 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
test_neg1517 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
test_neg1518 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
test_neg1519 no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
test_neg1520 best described as i know what you did last winter . 
test_neg1521 it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
test_neg1522 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
test_neg1523 an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art . 
test_neg1524 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
test_neg1525 barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
test_neg1526 writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
test_neg1527 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
test_neg1528 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
test_neg1529 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
test_neg1530 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
test_neg1531 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
test_neg1532 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
test_neg1533 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
test_neg1534 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
test_neg1535 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
test_neg1536 well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
test_neg1537 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
test_neg1538 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
test_neg1539 leaks treacle from every pore . 
test_neg1540 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
test_neg1541 blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
test_neg1542 if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
test_neg1543 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
test_neg1544 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
test_neg1545 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
test_neg1546 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
test_neg1547 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
test_neg1548 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
test_neg1549 like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
test_neg1550 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
test_neg1551 jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
test_neg1552 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
test_neg1553 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
test_neg1554 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
test_neg1555 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
test_neg1556 its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
test_neg1557 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
test_neg1558 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
test_neg1559 collapses under its own meager weight . 
test_neg1560 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
test_neg1561 death might be a release . 
test_neg1562 '[hopkins]doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it . no , even that's too committed . he gets his secretary to fax it . " 
test_neg1563 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
test_neg1564 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
test_neg1565 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
test_neg1566 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
test_neg1567 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
test_neg1568 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
test_neg1569 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
test_neg1570 this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
test_neg1571  . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
test_neg1572 it's just plain boring . 
test_neg1573 really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
test_neg1574 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
test_neg1575 a half-assed film . 
test_neg1576 the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
test_neg1577 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
test_neg1578 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
test_neg1579 cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
test_neg1580 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
test_neg1581 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
test_neg1582 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
test_neg1583 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
test_neg1584 [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
test_neg1585 nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
test_neg1586 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
test_neg1587  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
test_neg1588 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
test_neg1589 the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
test_neg1590 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
test_neg1591 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
test_neg1592 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
test_neg1593 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
test_neg1594 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
test_neg1595 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
test_neg1596 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
test_neg1597 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
test_neg1598 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
test_neg1599 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
test_neg1600 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
test_neg1601 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
test_neg1602 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
test_neg1603 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
test_neg1604 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
test_neg1605 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
test_neg1606 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
test_neg1607 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
test_neg1608 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
test_neg1609 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
test_neg1610 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
test_neg1611 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
test_neg1612 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
test_neg1613 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
test_neg1614 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
test_neg1615 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
test_neg1616 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
test_neg1617 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
test_neg1618 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
test_neg1619 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
test_neg1620 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
test_neg1621 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
test_neg1622 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
test_neg1623 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
test_neg1624 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
test_neg1625 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
test_neg1626 can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
test_neg1627  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
test_neg1628 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
test_neg1629 muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
test_neg1630 too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
test_neg1631 `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
test_neg1632 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
test_neg1633 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
test_neg1634 why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
test_neg1635 a grating , emaciated flick . 
test_neg1636 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
test_neg1637 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
test_neg1638 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
test_neg1639 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
test_neg1640 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
test_neg1641 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
test_neg1642 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
test_neg1643 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
test_neg1644 adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
test_neg1645 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
test_neg1646 slap me , i saw this movie . 
test_neg1647 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
test_neg1648 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
test_neg1649 bland but harmless . 
test_neg1650 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
test_neg1651 five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
test_neg1652 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
test_neg1653 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
test_neg1654 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
test_neg1655 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
test_neg1656 wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
test_neg1657 what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
test_neg1658 a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
test_neg1659 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
test_neg1660 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
test_neg1661 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
test_neg1662 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
test_neg1663 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
test_neg1664 the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
test_neg1665 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
test_neg1666 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
test_neg1667 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
test_neg1668 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
test_neg1669 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
test_neg1670 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
test_neg1671 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
test_neg1672 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
test_neg1673 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
test_neg1674 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
test_neg1675 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
test_neg1676  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
test_neg1677 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
test_neg1678 basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
test_neg1679 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
test_neg1680 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
test_neg1681 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
test_neg1682 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
test_neg1683 an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
test_neg1684 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
test_neg1685 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
test_neg1686 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
test_neg1687 the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
test_neg1688 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
test_neg1689 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
test_neg1690 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
test_neg1691 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
test_neg1692 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
test_neg1693 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
test_neg1694 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
test_neg1695 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
test_neg1696 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
test_neg1697 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
test_neg1698 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
test_neg1699 whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
test_neg1700 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
test_neg1701 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
test_neg1702 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
test_neg1703 amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
test_neg1704 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
test_neg1705 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
test_neg1706 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
test_neg1707 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
test_neg1708 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
test_neg1709 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
test_neg1710 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
test_neg1711 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
test_neg1712 episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
test_neg1713 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
test_neg1714 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
test_neg1715 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
test_neg1716 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
test_neg1717 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
test_neg1718 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
test_neg1719 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
test_neg1720 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
test_neg1721 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
test_neg1722 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
test_neg1723 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
test_neg1724 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
test_neg1725 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
test_neg1726 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
test_neg1727 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
test_neg1728 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
test_neg1729 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
test_neg1730 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
test_neg1731 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
test_neg1732 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
test_neg1733 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
test_neg1734 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
test_neg1735  " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
test_neg1736 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
test_neg1737 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
test_neg1738 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
test_neg1739 tends to plod . 
test_neg1740 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
test_neg1741 it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .

test_neg1743 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
test_neg1744 this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
test_neg1745 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
test_neg1746 when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
test_neg1747 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
test_neg1748 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
test_neg1749 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
test_neg1750 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
test_neg1751 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
test_neg1752 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
test_neg1753 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
test_neg1754 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
test_neg1755 a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
test_neg1756 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
test_neg1757 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
test_neg1758 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
test_neg1759 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
test_neg1760 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
test_neg1761 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
test_neg1762 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
test_neg1763 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
test_neg1764 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
test_neg1765 a major waste . . . generic . 
test_neg1766 falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
test_neg1767 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
test_neg1768 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
test_neg1769 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
test_neg1770 phoned-in business as usual . 
test_neg1771 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
test_neg1772 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
test_neg1773 when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
test_neg1774 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
test_neg1775 plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
test_neg1776 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
test_neg1777 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
test_neg1778 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
test_neg1779 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
test_neg1780 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
test_neg1781 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
test_neg1782 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
test_neg1783 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
test_neg1784 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
test_neg1785 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
test_neg1786 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
test_neg1787 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
test_neg1788 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
test_neg1789 most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
test_neg1790 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
test_neg1791 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
test_neg1792 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
test_neg1793 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
test_neg1794 long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
test_neg1795 boring and meandering . 
test_neg1796 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
test_neg1797 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
test_neg1798 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
test_neg1799 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
test_neg1800 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
test_neg1801 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
test_neg1802 feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
test_neg1803 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
test_neg1804 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
test_neg1805 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
test_neg1806 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
test_neg1807 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
test_neg1808 more tiring than anything . 
test_neg1809 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
test_neg1810 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
test_neg1811 overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
test_neg1812 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
test_neg1813 less than fresh . 
test_neg1814 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
test_neg1815 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
test_neg1816 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
test_neg1817 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
test_neg1818 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
test_neg1819 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
test_neg1820 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
test_neg1821 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
test_neg1822 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
test_neg1823 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
test_neg1824 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
test_neg1825 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
test_neg1826 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
test_neg1827 caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia . 
test_neg1828 an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
test_neg1829 it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
test_neg1830 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
test_neg1831 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
test_neg1832 a lame comedy . 
test_neg1833 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
test_neg1834 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
test_neg1835 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
test_neg1836 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
test_neg1837 it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
test_neg1838 this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
test_neg1839 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
test_neg1840 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
test_neg1841  . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
test_neg1842 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
test_neg1843 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
test_neg1844  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
test_neg1845 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
test_neg1846 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
test_neg1847 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
test_neg1848 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
test_neg1849 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
test_neg1850 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
test_neg1851 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
test_neg1852 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
test_neg1853 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
test_neg1854 it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
test_neg1855 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
test_neg1856 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
test_neg1857 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
test_neg1858 bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
test_neg1859 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
test_neg1860 it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
test_neg1861 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
test_neg1862 far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
test_neg1863 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
test_neg1864 this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
test_neg1865 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
test_neg1866 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
test_neg1867 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
test_neg1868 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
test_neg1869 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
test_neg1870 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
test_neg1871 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
test_neg1872 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
test_neg1873 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
test_neg1874 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
test_neg1875 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
test_neg1876 this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
test_neg1877 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
test_neg1878 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
test_neg1879 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
test_neg1880 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
test_neg1881 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
test_neg1882 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
test_neg1883 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
test_neg1884 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
test_neg1885 mildly entertaining . 
test_neg1886 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
test_neg1887 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
test_neg1888 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
test_neg1889 the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
test_neg1890  . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
test_neg1891 all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
test_neg1892 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
test_neg1893 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
test_neg1894 with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
test_neg1895 a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
test_neg1896 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
test_neg1897 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
test_neg1898 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
test_neg1899 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
test_neg1900 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
test_neg1901 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
test_neg1902  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
test_neg1903 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
test_neg1904 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
test_neg1905 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
test_neg1906 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
test_neg1907 a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
test_neg1908 a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
test_neg1909 whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
test_neg1910 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
test_neg1911 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
test_neg1912 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .

test_neg2020 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
test_neg2021 [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
test_neg2022 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
test_neg2023 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
test_neg2024 even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .

test_neg2027 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
test_neg2028 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .

test_neg2030 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
test_neg2031 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
test_neg2032 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
test_neg2033  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
test_neg2034 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .

test_neg2037 hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
test_neg2038 a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much .

test_neg2040 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
test_neg2041 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
test_neg2042 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
test_neg2043 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
test_neg2044 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
test_neg2045 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
test_neg2046 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
test_neg2047 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
test_neg2048 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
test_neg2049 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
test_neg2050 the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
test_neg2051 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
test_neg2052 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
test_neg2053 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
test_neg2054 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
test_neg2055 it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
test_neg2056 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
test_neg2057 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
test_neg2058 the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
test_neg2059 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
test_neg2060 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
test_neg2061 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
test_neg2062 the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
test_neg2063 you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
test_neg2064 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
test_neg2065 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
test_neg2066 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
test_neg2067 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
test_neg2068 it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
test_neg2069 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
test_neg2070 it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped em together here . 
test_neg2071 it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
test_neg2072 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
test_neg2073 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
test_neg2074 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
test_neg2075 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
test_neg2076 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
test_neg2077 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
test_neg2078 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
test_neg2079 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
test_neg2080 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
test_neg2081 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
test_neg2082 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
test_neg2083 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
test_neg2084 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
test_neg2085 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
test_neg2086 it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
test_neg2087 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
test_neg2088 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
test_neg2089 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
test_neg2090 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
test_neg2091 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
test_neg2092 earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
test_neg2093 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
test_neg2094 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
test_neg2095 it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
test_neg2096 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
test_neg2097 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
test_neg2098 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
test_neg2099 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
test_neg2100 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
test_neg2101  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
test_neg2102 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
test_neg2103 suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
test_neg2104 fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
test_neg2105 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
test_neg2106 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
test_neg2107 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
test_neg2108 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
test_neg2109 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
test_neg2110 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
test_neg2111 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
test_neg2112 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
test_neg2113 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
test_neg2114  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
test_neg2115 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
test_neg2116 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
test_neg2117 flat , misguided comedy . 
test_neg2118 girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
test_neg2119 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
test_neg2120 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
test_neg2121 lurid and less than lucid work . 
test_neg2122 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
test_neg2123 a porn film without the sex scenes . 
test_neg2124 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
test_neg2125 a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
test_neg2126 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
test_neg2127 by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
test_neg2128 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
test_neg2129 yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
test_neg2130 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
test_neg2131 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
test_neg2132 in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
test_neg2133 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
test_neg2134 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
test_neg2135 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
test_neg2136 slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
test_neg2137  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
test_neg2138  " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
test_neg2139 strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
test_neg2140 one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
test_neg2141 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
test_neg2142 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
test_neg2143 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
test_neg2144 the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
test_neg2145 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
test_neg2146 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
test_neg2147 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
test_neg2148 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
test_neg2149 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
test_neg2150 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
test_neg2151 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
test_neg2152 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
test_neg2153 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
test_neg2154 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
test_neg2155 the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
test_neg2156 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
test_neg2157 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
test_neg2158 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
test_neg2159 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
test_neg2160 i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
test_neg2161 predictably melodramatic . 
test_neg2162 the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
test_neg2163  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
test_neg2164 the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
test_neg2165 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
test_neg2166 disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other john woo flick for that matter . 
test_neg2167 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
test_neg2168 my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
test_neg2169 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
test_neg2170 filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
test_neg2171 solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
test_neg2172 the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
test_neg2173 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
test_neg2174 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
test_neg2175 such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
test_neg2176 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
test_neg2177 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
test_neg2178 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
test_neg2179 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
test_neg2180 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
test_neg2181 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
test_neg2182 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
test_neg2183 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
test_neg2184 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
test_neg2185 showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
test_neg2186 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
test_neg2187 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
test_neg2188 you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
test_neg2189 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
test_neg2190 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
test_neg2191 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
test_neg2192 behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
test_neg2193 more trifle than triumph . 
test_neg2194 the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
test_neg2195 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
test_neg2196 there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
test_neg2197 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
test_neg2198 no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
test_neg2199 it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
test_neg2200 the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
test_neg2201 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
test_neg2202 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
test_neg2203 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
test_neg2204 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
test_neg2205 rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
test_neg2206 the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
test_neg2207 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
test_neg2208 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
test_neg2209 a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
test_neg2210 where the film falters is in its tone . 
test_neg2211 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
test_neg2212 ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
test_neg2213 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
test_neg2214 definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
test_neg2215 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
test_neg2216 the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
test_neg2217 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
test_neg2218 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
test_neg2219 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
test_neg2220 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
test_neg2221 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
test_neg2222 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
test_neg2223 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
test_neg2224 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
test_neg2225 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
test_neg2226 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
test_neg2227 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
test_neg2228 competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
test_neg2229 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
test_neg2230 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
test_neg2231 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
test_neg2232 swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
test_neg2233 the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
test_neg2234 a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
test_neg2235 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
test_neg2236 this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
test_neg2237 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
test_neg2238 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
test_neg2239 an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
test_neg2240 talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
test_neg2241 the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
test_neg2242 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
test_neg2243 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
test_neg2244  . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
test_neg2245 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
test_neg2246 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
test_neg2247 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
test_neg2248 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
test_neg2249 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
test_neg2250 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
test_neg2251 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
test_neg2252 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
test_neg2253 it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
test_neg2254 the drama discloses almost nothing . 
test_neg2255 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
test_neg2256 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
test_neg2257 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
test_neg2258 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
test_neg2259 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
test_neg2260 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
test_neg2261 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
test_neg2262 one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
test_neg2263 though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
test_neg2264 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
test_neg2265 it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
test_neg2266 chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
test_neg2267  . . . a rather bland affair . 
test_neg2268 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
test_neg2269 i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
test_neg2270 a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
test_neg2271 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
test_neg2272 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . 
test_neg2273 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
test_neg2274 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
test_neg2275 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
test_neg2276 this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
test_neg2277 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
test_neg2278 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
test_neg2279 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
test_neg2280 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
test_neg2281 the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
test_neg2282 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
test_neg2283 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
test_neg2284 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
test_neg2285 the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
test_neg2286 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
test_neg2287 [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
test_neg2288  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
test_neg2289 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
test_neg2290 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
test_neg2291 you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
test_neg2292 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
test_neg2293 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
test_neg2294 eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
test_neg2295 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
test_neg2296 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
test_neg2297 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
test_neg2298 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
test_neg2299 staggeringly dreadful romance . 
test_neg2300 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
test_neg2301 final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
test_neg2302 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
test_neg2303 further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
test_neg2304 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
test_neg2305 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
test_neg2306  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
test_neg2307 humor in i spy is so anemic . 
test_neg2308 a real snooze . 
test_neg2309 skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
test_neg2310 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
test_neg2311 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
test_neg2312 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
test_neg2313 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
test_neg2314 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
test_neg2315 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
test_neg2316 queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
test_neg2317 it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
test_neg2318 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
test_neg2319 it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
test_neg2320 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
test_neg2321 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
test_neg2322 you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
test_neg2323 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
test_neg2324 it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
test_neg2325 narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
test_neg2326 his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
test_neg2327 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
test_neg2328 there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
test_neg2329 as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
test_neg2330 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
