This is a project that I tried to use doc2vec and semantic orientation as features to perform sentiment analysis classification task. <br />
Doc2Vec is a technique extend from Word2vec that modeling a paragraph as a vector, original paper can be seen in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053) <br />
Semantic Orientation is an idea presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212032) <br />
Result : I get 1% accuracy boost by using my model
